The old README file is preserved below, these are my own comments:

Someone sent me this nifty tool to interface with xmms.  It was in C++, I
ported it back to C and made some changes to facilitate use in a script as
opposed to use on the command line (although it is perfectly workable as a
command line utility).  This software seems to be public domain, and it
shall remain such.

To build: run make, if you have everything you need, it will work.  This is
intended to be used in the anduril script, but can be used elsehwere.  Enjoy

--------------- OLD README FILE HERE -----------------------
Epic(4)-tool to get the current song from XMMS
----------------------------------------------------

Needed: xmms-dev/xmms & glib-dev, g++

INSTALL:
1)	Just type 'make' (maybe you'll have to edit Makefile to fit your system)

2)	This will compile the executable file "epic-xmms".

3)	Then insert this in your ~/.ircrc or whatever script-file you use for epic4:

		/load ~/path/to/epic-xmms.epic

	And if you dont want to see the nasty process ended crap in Epic:
		on ^exec_errors "*" {}
		on ^exec_exit "*" {}
		(NOTE: Remove this from you .ircrc: on ^exec "*" {} else you
		can't see the output from /jump if there is more than one hit)

4)	Now, fire up your epic and write /xmms, /next, /back, /stop, /play 
	/pause, /mute, /shuffle, /repeat, /jump <song> :-) 
	(requires xmms running, duuh)

NOTES:
	It reads the ID3-tag from the mp3 you are listening too..
	
	This program was NOT maked too output a lot of crap to a channel, 
	but just a small helpfull thing.
	
	Notice that the /jump function in 0.4 was case-sensitive, that is
	now changed. and thats is NICE!

	The /jump function now supports a nifty feature, imagine you have 
	too mp3s called:
		artist - number.mp3
		artist - number remix.mp3
	Then it can be difficoult to find a matching string for song 2, so
	i implemented that you can write '/jump artist 2' to go directly to
	the second song that matched the string 'artist'.
