a dark seed of evil is grown ...
horror and madness I've seen here ...
the king is dead! long live the king!
free yourself from yourself ...
kill what you want me to, take what's left and eat it
I wanna see the ground give way...
it's not a want of drugs, it's a want of personal freedom.
deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
und keine eier
