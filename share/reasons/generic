the world shall hear this sad song ...
free yourself from yourself ...
kill what you want me to, take what's left and eat it
it brings us closer than dying ... and cancer ... and crying ...
I wanna see the ground give way...
dreaming of that face again ... it's bright and blue and shimmering ...
it's not a want of drugs, it's a want of personal freedom.
deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
