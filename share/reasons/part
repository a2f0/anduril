a dark seed of evil is grown ...
horror and madness I've seen here ...
the fate of us all lies deep in the dark ...
the king is dead! long live the king!
mirror, mirror on the wall ... true hope lies beyond the coast ...
that love means death I realized too soon ...
caught in the afterlife, I've gone too far ...
the world shall hear this sad song ...
free yourself from yourself ...
locked up inside you like the calm beneath castles ...
kill what you want me to, take what's left and eat it
it brings us closer than dying ... and cancer ... and crying ...
I wanna see the ground give way...
dreaming of that face again ... it's bright and blue and shimmering ...
it's not a want of drugs, it's a want of personal freedom.
deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
