[0: Preface / Requirements]:

I think all of the information in this file is valid and at least somewhat
important, but you may disagree, so be it.  If you don't want to read
another word, please read the following, and section 1, and then go have
fun!

Requirements:
1. A modicum of knowledge of navigating Unix file systems, and doing simple
   tasks within the system, as well as a very basic knowledge of IRC.
2. ircII-EPIC4-1.1.7+ (I have changed my policy on client version and
   script development, see below for reasons[3])  You might get away with
   something a little lower, but I don't recommend trying.
3. Roughly 2mb of free disk space (this does not include space needed for
   logging, or anything extra you do.)  The development branch, with no
   extra junk in the directory, is about 1.4mb.  Most of this is used by the
   modules.  The script is commented quite heavily, and if there is
   sufficient interest I'll be happy to produce a version without any
   comments whatsoever for the general public to use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1: For people who just can't wait]:

Setup: Extract the script.  Make sure it all came out okay.  That's it.

Loading is simple, just /load <path to script>/anduril.irc
You may want to change/try different skins.  Check out the /slist command
for lists of skins.  You might also want to do other customizations, Play
around with /config, /flist, and /format.  Enjoy!

Lastly, and I shouldn't even need to say this, /ahelp will help in a pinch
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2: For the less lazy, or for the lazy where #1 didn't work]: 

There's actually not much to say here anymore, at least if you just want to be
in the 'less lazy' category.  Previously, the script required some work to
move it around, that should theoretically no longer be the case.  HOWEVER, if
just loading the script doesn't work for you, then your system is missing the
realpath(3) function.  I'd appreciate it if you let me know what system
you're running on.  Then, to fix this, edit the file "anduril.irc", and change
the line that says:
@apath = before(-1 / $realpath($word(1 $loadinfo())))  
to:
@apath = twiddle(~/anduril)
(or wherever you put it).  This *should* fix any problems you might be having.
I know realpath(3) exists on non-archaic versions of FreeBSD, Linux, SunOS,
and IRIX.  (I've tested these all directly)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3: For people who want to know more]: 

This is actually only a small sample of the documentation I've written for
this script.  Nothing bugs me more than a program or script for which there
is no documentation, and a lot of times when I got stuck on a script
problem, I'd come back and document.  You'll find lots of stuff in the all
caps files in this current directory, and tons of stuff in the doc/
directory.  Some of it may interest you, some of it may not.  If you think
something ought to be better documented, let me know, I'll probably just say
you're whiney, but hey....you never know, right?  If you have a question
about how something works, feel free to ask.

Policy on script release/client compatibility:
When I started this script, I wanted to stick to developing on the oldest
release EPIC I could (at the time EPIC4-2000) to provide high compatibility
for people.  However, I feel that people will be better suited with a script
that may ask them to upgrade their client, but that will run faster and better
because of the new client.  I don't develop on alpha EPICs, but I will
develop on beta EPICs.  I try to track the latest changes in EPIC and make
this script take advantage of them, so if a new change has been made in a
beta that I'd like to use, I will up the requirements on the next release.
hop's releases (alpha and especially beta, and uber-especially actual
releases) are always very stable, so I'm not much concerned about stability
problems.  So there you go, that's why you should upgrade.  I will provide
ample warning between minor versions in regards to upgrade necessity in
the form of a very intrusive warning when the script is loaded.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4: Where to get this script (and other resources)]:

Well yes, you do already have it, however, updates will (hopefully) happen
frequently.  There are several places from whence you can get this script:

WWW: http://www.anduril.org/script/
     http://scripts.epicsol.org/           <--.  NOT GAURANTEED TO
     http://irc.themes.org/                <--'  BE UP TO DATE!

FTP: ftp://ftp.anduril.org/pub/anduril/script/ (XXX: broken)

CVS: cvs.telekinesis.org:
     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.telekinesis.org:/home/cvs login
     (password: anoncvs)
     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.telekinesis.org:/home/cvs co anduril
     There is also a CVSweb interface available at:
     http://cvs.telekinesis.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/anduril/

IRC: #anduril on DALnet (irc.dal.net) from wd-xdcc.  This should be your
     last resort.  I may or may not be running my xdcc client this week, I'm
     a very forgetful person like that.  I may be in #anduril on EFnet, and
     I may have the latest on my xdcc list.  No guarantees.
     - please don't complain to me about why my channel is on DALnet and
       not EFnet.  I'm already aware that the majority of UNIX console IRC
       users are probably on EFnet, but I just don't fucking care, okay?

Mailing lists:
     Two mailing lists are provided for script users:
     script@anduril.org:  For general help and questions (and discussion)
     about the script, go here.  To subscribe or make other administrative
     requests, send a mail with the canonical majordomo actions to:
     script-request@anduril.org.  Alternatively, you can visit the site:
     http://lists.anduril.org/listinfo/anduril-script

     cvs@anduril.org:  This list is moderated, and is the point of receipt for
     cvs commit messages.  To subscribe/etc, follow the above instructions, but
     replace 'script' with 'cvs'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5: Writing modules]:

First of all, read doc/core.  This tells you all the stuff I wrote that you
don't have to.  Most of it is stuff for the core, but there are some important
functions in there.  I will probably be writing a module writer's guide soon,
fwiw.

After that, have a look at all the other files in doc (config, formats,
modules) they contain useful imformation on module syntax.

And if you wrote the most k-rad super elite module ever and want it included
in the script, or just posted on the script's website, drop down to the
contacts section and send me your stuff.

No, I will NOT post war/nuke/packet kidlet/lameassbitch modules.  Don't even
ask.  Most EPIC users are more mature than that anyways.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[6: Why is this script so 'slow'?]

This is probably no longer very valid.  If you find the script slow please
let me know what kind of hardware you have, where it is being slow, and if
you have any suggestions for improvement.  Thanks.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[7: Rants and other nonsense]

(This used to be at the top of the file, but it doesn't belong there)

First, it's pronounced and-oo-ril, just to get that out of the way.  It
comes from Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, in case you wondered.

I wrote this script because I got tired of some of BX's obnoxious features,
mostly all the lame shit that seemed like packet-kiddie/warez-pup crap, and
the way it interpreted stuff, and with a src download of well over 1mb (1.5
I think) the inherent bloat in the thing. So I moved to EPIC, but found that
none of the scripts really did everything I wanted them to do, and since I
haven't written a major IRC script in something like four years, and
moreover have never done so for ircII, I figured I'd try my hand at it. (I
need to say I owe a lot of thanks to the people in #epic on EFnet for
helping me with my scripting in general)

This script is meant to be completely modular, i.e., if you don't want it,
don't load it.  The core script contains *nothing* but module support for
configuration, formatting, and actual execution.  There aren't even any
/on's, in fact, the script won't even introduce itself without loading the
appropriate modules.  Somewhere along the line my golden dream failed
somewhat. The script is still really really modular.  You can still take out
oodles of stuff, and in theory you could swiss-cheese the thing to death and
it would be okay, but some modules make allowances for other modules.  Take
skins for example.  There has to be a special allowance for both status bars
and colors, I couldn't find a good way around that, so i made a special
allowance.  It's no longer perfect, but it's still quite good, I think.  If
you are the average user chances are you won't care two licks about any of
this, but then...you are reading a section emblazoned with the name 'Rants
and other nonsense.'

There are a few other small exceptions, sort of.  Operationally, of course,
it would be impossible to create a core for modules without having some
code that is aliases and variables.  For a list of these see doc/core.

This script contains no backdoors.  Go ahead, look.  I'm not like that.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[97: I wanna help! (PUT MY NAME IN THE CREDITS, BITCH)]:

Cool! I need:

- To know that people are using this thing.  Please, email me (yes, my
  email works now!) and let me know if you're using the script.  Tell me
  what you like, what you dislike, and what you want.  At this point, after
  having invested a decent chunk of time, I think I just need to hear that
  three or four people like/use this script to continue with it.  This is still
  true, even though I have a verifiable userbase of at least 10 people. ;)
- Modules with special support for other IRC networks (non EF/DALnet)
- General cool stuff (if you're in the mood, be creative!)
- ANSI art for the opener.  I'd really like three or four nice color ANSI
  logos to spout at the user upon startup, anyone who could provide these
  would be a truly princely individual.  Please please *please* :)
- Suggestions!  I really want to know what people want as features in their
  IRC scripts.  Even if you're the only one who wants it, or so you think,
  I'd still like to hear from you.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[98: Credits]:

Code contribution:
.........tbaur: first person to get commit access to the script.  tim has
                already done a bunch of stuff in the first week to make the
                script more useful on multiple networks.

Others:
cait-sith/mike: encouragement is good
........VaultX: earliest beta tester, lots of ideas etc
............PS: beta tester, ideas too!  very faithful little knee-grow
.........valar: lots of debugging, constructive (typically) criticism, and
                faithfulness.
............ld: suggestions, ideas, and more.  thanks!
..........john: for scoring me the second half of lateralus, as well
                as providing good feature/bug input, and a bunch of
                other stuff (dvd == elite)
.........daedo: For ideas borrowed from core.  Too bad yer a windoze bitch
                now!@
...........sja: for the nifty 'countries' db with phone codes!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[99: Points of contact]:

If you want to send me cookies, kudos, thanks, applause, naked pictures of
yourself (men need not apply), or any other matter of good paraphernalia, or
if you just want to ask me a question, you can find me in the following
places:

IRC      : DALnet (just about always there): White_Dragon, wd
           EFnet (rarely): WhiteDrgn, sometimes wd
Email    : wd@anduril.org
Real life: Chip Norkus
Address  : If you really really want it just ask.

Addendum : PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT EMAIL ME ASKING ME HOW TO SETUP THE
	   SCRIPT!  If you can't figure it out, then well, you probably
	   shouldn't be using either the client or the script.  If you ask
	   me a question I covered in this file, I will instantly trash your
	   email.  I get a lot of email, IRC not withstanding, and I just
	   don't have time to help those who can't help themselves.  I'm
	   doubly disappointed because I wrote this before I got email from
	   people, but now I AM getting email anyways.  Ugh!
