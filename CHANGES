Changes in 1.2b6:

o Added a keybinding for mesgview (alt+m or esc+m) and made mesgview and
  operview hiding work right.

o The network code will use the NETWORK value from the 005 numeric

o Make server-specific feature files (share/server/*) a bit more 'modular'
  (i.e. keep them from duplicating so much code)

o Added autowin module by erik.

o Added a 'current_topic' format.  I don't know why I didn't just do this
  before.  It is a slave of the 'topic' format but has a slightly different
  look (as it should.  duh.  inspired by entropy)

o Hopefully fixed a weird bug with the window module unsetting the wrong
  aliases.

o Added xterm_title config and format pair in the status module.

o I finally did it!  A new userlist module has been written.  It is, FOR THE
  PRESENT userlist2.  I'd like for people who need userlist stuffs to play
  with it and make sure it works so all the bugs can be ironed out.  At some
  point it WILL OVERWRITE the original userlist module!

o Added 'ignore_away_replies' config to the msg module to ignore repeated
  away replies.

o Added /identify command to bahamut.  (erik)

o Added handling for Undernet numeric 330 (RPL_WHOISLOGGEDINAS or some such
  nonsense)

o Added a telnet module (courtesy of erik)

o Added a 'dcc_autoget' config to the dcc module (courtesy of erik)

o Added /wn and /wp aliases suggested by dan@EFnet

o The window module now binds alt-1+alt-1 to move to window 11, etc, and
  creates new bindings as new windows are created (only works with epic
  1.1.7+)

o /banstat now numbers bans, and those numbers can be used by the /unban
  command.

o /map now works.  You can /map from any point on the network.  Thanks to
  Liandrim for some helpful pointers.

o /links code massively rewritten.  /links output should be a lot more
  sensical and easy to parse now.

o Added /ovwall, /vwall to the standard /wall set.

o Added a /wq command for querying folks. (sergio)

o Added an 'xmms_auto_echo' config, which may be toggled to keep the xmms
  module from automatically outputting the currently playing mp3. (sergio)

o The /timestamp command now assumes + if it isn't specified. (sergio)

o The oper_modes config is now a string, to allow for long-form undernet
  modes. (sergio)

o The network code now uses server groups for speed whenever possible.

Changes in 1.2b5:

o Added /links -t.  This displays the links list as a table with each hub
  as a column.  In general, you'll want a wide screen to view this as it
  can get very horizontally long.  Thanks to adm for the cool idea.

o Rewrote timestamping.  It's now handled significantly differently.  All of
  your ts_* configs have basically been obsoleted.  You can now manage
  timestamps with the 'timestamp' config (and command).  I will try, as I move
  along, to provide ways to timestamp just about everything.  Along with the
  stuff previously supported, I've added support for a few new values:
  - banner: all regular banners are replaced by timestamps
  - server: all data sent through the server-echo alias is timestamped

  Currently, the defaults for timestamping are 'away' and 'log'.  It is (for
  the time being) necessary to specify each type in the config, so I recommend
  that you use the /timestamp (/ts) command to manage things.  In the future I
  may provide some meta-types to wrap this sort of thing (especially 'all').

o Added a 'meta' tag for modules.  Timestamping now uses this.

o Added 'msg_shorten_host' config.  See /ahelp. :)

o Added findk command. This command checks stats K for a given mask. It also
  allows you to remove the kline with -remove. Taken from adm/odelay -tbaur

o Added kline support for hybrid - tbaur

o Added the mail module, as suggested by joey@EFnet.

o Added /ctcp SOURCE reply in the version module as suggested by a bundle
  of folks.

o Added a hiword_away_log config.  /ahelp conf hiword_away_log as usual. :)

o /readlog (away) won't be automatically run if you have no messages.  This
  may leave garbage files.  I'll see about better cleaning for this later.

o Added server support for hybrid. There is now a combined support file for
  both bahamut and hybrid since much of the formating is similar. Added
  support for numerous things, client connect/disconnect, stats/links/motd
  and gline formating for hybrid. Client related are defined by "client" and
  the others as "notice" for sfilter support -tbaur

o Fixed kline aliases, not as generic now. Will accept "/kline nick message"
  instead of "/kline nick :message" and added various other aliases.
	/kline, /unkline, /pkline (defaults to perm /kline), /tkline (allows
	you to define the time (/kline 30 ...), /dline, /undline, /zline,
	and /gline -tbaur

o Added support for dalnet operserv2, /os2+formatting -tbaur

o Fixed color on the last two brackets of akill formatting -tbaur

o Finally fixed some /links stuff.  Also on EFnet (and other similarly named
  networks) we don't try to chop the names up anymore.  Shrug.

o /ctcp <foo> ping now sends a proper ping request, instead of nothing (raven)

o With sfilter rules, a filtered message can now be logged with an explicit
  'log' statement in that rule. (tbaur)

o Fixed /conf cloak.  It now takes numbers as well as a list of specific
  types of ctcp to block.  See /ahelp conf cloak. (tbaur)

o Another logging tweak.  Log directories are now separated by date-of-archival
  in the tarfile. (tbaur)

o More logging tweaks.  log_archive_compress is more fault tolerant, and
  strange channel names shouldn't cause breakage (tbaur)

o /flist for format display is now unnumbered to fix an intuitiveness issue
  (zphinx)

o Fixed the timestamp format breakage (tbaur/eve)

o Made a cleaner default format for /whois (tbaur)

o Fixed a bug causing an infinite loop using /sfilter (skill)

o Fixed a bug in /wall caused by new semantics for /msg and /notice builtin
  commands (Zukee)

o Made the things which use sfilters a little less.. sensitive to the server
  module coming and going.

Changes in 1.2b4:

o Fixed a bug that was created by the log archiver rotating files, causing the
  away logger to break unmercifully (awyeah).

o Moved the 'kill' format and other things to the server module.  The server
  module is now a little more specific about things which it outputs thanks to
  the 'banner_mod' format (also new).  It will now output a single letter
  which describes (roughly) what the server module feels is relevant.  It's
  intuitive, just keep an eye on it.

o Added the /sfilter command.  IRC OPERATORS PAY ATTENTION.  A lot of the oper
  stuff has completely changed around and you'll need to read up on the 
  /sfilter command.  This should allow to configure things *exactly* the way
  you want them, though.  Enjoy!  With /sfilter some things are going away,
  like the wallops_window config and the /akillwin command.  These are being
  replaced by more robust systems.

o Added log archiving.  USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.  I do not gaurantee the
  sanctity of your files right now, *especially* if you use multiple clients
  simultaneously!  I have tried to avoid trouncing stuff, but I just can't make
  those gaurantees!  If you're curious, /conf log_arch* and have a look.

o Fixed a tiny bug in /stats ?

o Fixed a bug with overlapping descriptors in the logger. (justin)

o Fixed fd-leak problems in the ignore and userlist modules caused by either
  not, or improperly, closing file descriptors for savefiles.  Yuck.  (john)

o Made the save module do more important things, like assist in saving file
  settings for everything.  This much simplifies my life, several modules
  will be changed ever-so-slightly to reflect this.

o Made some light changes to several modules, mostly bugfixes and behavior
  corrections of little import.

o Added an 'autojoin' config to the autojoin module which, if turned off,
  prevents the client from automatically joining channels at server connect
  time.  Also added '/autojoin *' to join all autojoin channels on the current
  network.

o Made a small fix which will hopefully prevent /update from knocking peoples'
  clients over in certain circumstances.  Thanks to hop for hunting this bug
  down.

o There is now a 'words' module which will do highlight/banned word detection
  in channel public messages/actions.

o Hopefully made the last few necessary changes to /who.  You can now do
  /who -f to flush the queue.  Also, fixed a small buggle in the behavior.

o Made /tbk work a bit better.  Also added a 'default_ban_time' config for
  use with all bans to make them all timed.  By default it is '0', meaning
  everything still works the same.

o Fixed some unintelligent uses of script-wrapped /who in various places.

o Added an autoop_delay config for wf to allow a static delay, or to allow
  for no delay.

o Made /who do the right thing on DALnet or Undernet (that is, automatically
  use -dx or -ux if they are supported).  This adds a new network cap and a new
  question in the /newnetwork command.  (brandy)

o Changed the builder to get all the relevant version data for modules,
  including share files.  This will result in a potentially monumental leap
  in version for a few modules with many sharefiles, but will make /update
  get new modules if their share files have been updated (which means skins,
  completion, et al will benefit from a re-build in terms of /update)

o Fixed a weird bug in the protection in the userlist module.  If someone
  is deopped by an entity outside the channel, no protection (re-oping)
  is done.

o Fixed some silly bugs in the xdcc module I introduced earlier.

o Added a -v flag to /lsmod to list module descriptions along with their
  loaded/unloaded status.  (james)

o Fixed autoload_oper so that the oper module isn't considered user-loaded
  if it is loaded at all. (raven, kinda)

o Fixed an obnoxious bug with /wnc and channel names without #s. (raven)

o Fixed a bug related to the logging module creating directories (bodge)

o Fixed a weird bug with deoping people and /scann-ing (note two ns) them.
  (Mourgos)

o Small fix to /tbk to make it "do the right thing."

o Light changes to autojoin to make it more multi-server friendly (patch
  courtesy of james)

o Added a small fix for /banstat to show the setter of bans at all times
  (Mourgos)

o You can now do: /color <x> format <y> <z> to set format y to z (i.e. /format
  y z) with the colors for 'x' made static.  This means that if you do, for
  instance:  /color 30 format status 3 then until you change the format for
  status again, those colors (red and blue in this case) will be static in the
  status bar, whether you change the generic colors with /color or not.  You
  can also do: /format y z color x.

o Made /sv targettable.  Why hadn't I done this before?  Who knows. (whitefang)

o Some cosmetic changes.  More formats now use their own display commands
  to look nice and stuff.

o More fixes to logging (got rid of that nasty exec :) (hop/john)

o Another fix to network code.  Oi.  (drac)

o Hopefully fixed quite a severe potential problem wiith logging not releasing
  fds across reconnects/join+parts/etc.. (john)

o /conf user_mode in the server module will now set a default usermode of
  whatever you set it to when connecting to a server.

Changes in 1.2b3:

o There is now cross-reference data for items which can be indexed with /help.
  At present very few things are cross-referenced, however for an example you
  can look at /ahelp man.  There are no checks on the validity of cross-refs.

o /finfo, /cfinfo, and /minfo are all gone, having been replaced by a much more
  comprehensive /help command.  /help is now more informative and useful as
  well.

o You can now create a window to receive messages with via the /mesgview
  command.  See also the 'mesgview_hidden', 'mesgview_size', and
  'mesgview_auto' settings.  You may want to /conf mesgview_auto on if you
  always want a message window.

o the 'operview_status' format is now called 'other_status' and can be used
  by anything which wants a single-line status titling the window (see above
  change)

o Fixed a small bug in the completion system involving %"" and %'' type lists.

o Took an axe to a lot of old variable names.  Specifically, a.<type>_list
  variables no longer exist!

o Doing a /modules will now refresh the listing of available modules that is
  stored by the modules module (how many more times can I say module today? :)
  (maloy)

o Hacked up the skins module a bit for sanity.  Now /ssave will try to preserve
  the author/description if the skin existed before.  This makes it easier for
  me to fix skins to go along with format changes.

o Added a -f flag to /update to force module downloads.

o Fixed 'removed time autokill' notice for the 14325235th time (brandy)

o Made /update grab updates for unloaded modules, too, as well as this file.

o Fixed a small bug in /format when looking at the format for something with
  an abbreviated name. (e.g. /format joi now does the right thing)

o /mop,mvoice,mdop,mdvoice all act a bit more sane (e.g. don't perform actions
  on people when it is unnecessary.) (john).

o Fixed two bugs in completion: people changing nicks will now be reflected in
  the tab-completer (jonas).  Also, /conf comp_msg_expire now behaves
  correctly.

o Fixed the scan-on-join broken-ness in some instances of joining. (several
  folks)

o Fixed /killclones (I hope)  (jonas).

o Fixed a screw-up on my part in gathering /stats data.

o Fixed several small bugs (updater, status, server, others)

o Added a handler for /stats ? on hybrid-type servers. (many people who
  wouldn't shut up about it ;)

Changes in 1.2b2:

o Fixed a bit of /join mismanagement courtesy of hop.

o A minor enhancement to the list module.  Numbered lists with a defined
  number of columns now only get one number per line.

o Finally got around to writing an interface to /ignore.  /ahelp ignore for
  info.  This addresses timed, regular, and permanent (that is, persistent
  across restart) ignores, as well as making them look decent.

o Fixed a bug where, if you were away and did an /rmlog, your logging would
  be really screwed until you /backed and /awayed again. You can now /rmlog
  whenever the mood strikes. (PS)

o Finally fixed that goddamn /unban bug which had pestered MANY people.

o /filter for voices/ops now works. (nick)

o /stats l formatting now works on undernet as well (nick)

o Fixed an old completion bug with cycling (john)

o Fixed the logger to tolower() filenames (john)

o Added a new config, check_clones_on_join.  Turning this on will check to
  see if the user joining a channel is a clone (that is, if there are any
  other people on the channel from the same host as him). (maloy)
 
Changes in 1.2b1:

o Added a new config, away_log_sent.  Turning this on logs messages sent, as
  well as received, in the away log. (jonas)

o Began differentiating special *network* support, and special server
  support.  Support for specific daemon features is now in share/server/*
  files and is handled by the server module.  This should be more-or-less
  transparent.

o It is now possible to align public text with the use of the align_public,
  align_public_min, and align_public_max configs.  Simply doing /set
  align_public on will work nicely for just about everyone. (john)

o Fixed a silly longstanding bug in the /set alias where /set -something
  didn't work right.

o Made /rlmod a lot smarter about reloading modules.  You can now reload
  a module without unloading its dependants, and if you /rlmod a depend-
  loaded module it will not be set as user-loaded as it was before.

o Made it possible to unload a module with dependencies all in one swipe
  (this is the default behavior now, so if you /rmmod channel, it will take
   lots of other things with it).

o fixed a silly bug with ac.hash() that always forced things to hash only
  the first 20 characters.

o the logging system for all modules has been replaced, and logging has been
  improved extensively via the log module.

o the /away module does better cleanup on exit now hopefully. (jonas)

o There's a new XMMS module.  Of course it's only useful if you use xmms,
  in which case you might want to /insmod xmms.

o Huge infrastructure changes have been made.  Most of them are not very
  interesting unless you're writing a module or something.

o /grep and /paste output are no longer lastlogged!  This fixes an annoying
  and longstanding bug. (thanks hop)
