A small roadmap:
o Addition of a real, menu-based help system.  To do this I'll be adding:
  - Meta-data for modules, configs, and formats.  This just means extended
    help data for these things.  Formats/configs will get long descriptions,
    modules will have some kind of varied topic structure.
  - The creation of a programmable menu browser-thingy.
o A real code audit.  Removal of all these idiotic single letter variables.
  This will, theoretically, allow me to get rid of the builtin_expando crap.
o More themes, formats, and other fun.  New skins and stuff.
o Other things not listed here but further down in the TODO.

This list is now completely unsorted.  I'll get to each of these if and when
I find time and desire.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
o filter ignore command using a.channel.filter
o Reminder feature, e.g. /remind <day(s)> at <time> <whatever>
o targets in timestamps
o DCC info in status bars
o Some sort of flood protection.
o Improve the /rel system (a lot)
o Some kind of real installer?  To ask questions etc?
o netsplit detection (probably in it's own module)
o reasons module (add/remove reasons from different files)
o Fix autojoin precmd to separate the 'wait for invite' semantics.
o menu module for interactive setup stuff, this is going to be tough
  so I moved it lower so I could get other work done.
o add cross-references for everything, and fix the formatting
o add more stuff in the oper module, will do this basically as
  requested
o random realname support
o cleanup for speed/size improvements.  convert aliases and functions
  to "function" format (alias foo (bar, baz)).  Make sure modules keep
  all of their aliases and assigns in their own structure (i.e.
  a.module.<crap>)
  (this is kind of an ongoing process, so I've probably done some, but
   it's something I can also probably do more of)
o stupid game modules (for vault)
